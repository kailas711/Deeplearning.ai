      "I think the sky is blue because... wait, there's something called atmospheric transparency. The air can pass through light, right? So when sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, some parts bend around themselves, making the sky look blue. That makes sense because it's a sort of scattering effect where shorter wavelengths are scattered more than longer ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember something about the Rayleigh scattering theory. It says that higher-energy photons (like visible light) scatter more easily and cause more redshift. So when sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere, the shorter blue and violet rays are scattered away, leaving us with more red and orange, which is why the sky looks blue to people on land.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how does this affect the colors of water bodies like oceans or lakes? I think water molecules scatter more than air molecules because they're smaller. This causes a different scattering pattern, often resulting in a more vibrant color seen from above.\n",
      "\n",
      "So putting it all together, the Earth's atmosphere scatters sunlight differently depending on whether it's passing through gases (like oxygen) or liquids (like water). Gases cause more redshift and scatter shorter wavelengths, making the sky blue. Liquids, being smaller, have different scattering properties that might contribute to colors observed from above.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, does this theory hold up? I think Rayleigh scattering is a simplified model, but it's a good approximation for gases like air. For water, maybe something more detailed like Mie theory applies, which considers size and wavelength interactions differently.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should structure the answer in 50 words or less. Maybe start with the atmospheric effect on the sky, then move on to how water bodies show different colors due to their composition. Also, mention that this is why we see blue during clear skies but vibrant during cloudy times.\n",
