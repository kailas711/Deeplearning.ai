    "summary": "Proteins are dynamic molecular machines whose biological functions, spanning\nenzymatic catalysis, signal transduction, and structural adaptation, are\nintrinsically linked to their motions. Designing proteins with targeted dynamic\nproperties, however, remains a challenge due to the complex, degenerate\nrelationships between sequence, structure, and molecular motion. Here, we\nintroduce VibeGen, a generative AI framework that enables end-to-end de novo\nprotein design conditioned on normal mode vibrations. VibeGen employs an\nagentic dual-model architecture, comprising a protein designer that generates\nsequence candidates based on specified vibrational modes and a protein\npredictor that evaluates their dynamic accuracy. This approach synergizes\ndiversity, accuracy, and novelty during the design process. Via full-atom\nmolecular simulations as direct validation, we demonstrate that the designed\nproteins accurately reproduce the prescribed normal mode amplitudes across the\nbackbone while adopting various stable, functionally relevant structures.\nNotably, generated sequences are de novo, exhibiting no significant similarity\nto natural proteins, thereby expanding the accessible protein space beyond\nevolutionary constraints. Our work integrates protein dynamics into generative\nprotein design, and establishes a direct, bidirectional link between sequence\nand vibrational behavior, unlocking new pathways for engineering biomolecules\nwith tailored dynamical and functional properties. This framework holds broad\nimplications for the rational design of flexible enzymes, dynamic scaffolds,\nand biomaterials, paving the way toward dynamics-informed AI-driven protein\nengineering.",

    "summary": "The de novo design of proteins refers to creating proteins with specific\nstructures and functions that do not naturally exist. In recent years, the\naccumulation of high-quality protein structure and sequence data and\ntechnological advancements have paved the way for the successful application of\ngenerative artificial intelligence (AI) models in protein design. These models\nhave surpassed traditional approaches that rely on fragments and\nbioinformatics. They have significantly enhanced the success rate of de novo\nprotein design, and reduced experimental costs, leading to breakthroughs in the\nfield. Among various generative AI models, diffusion models have yielded the\nmost promising results in protein design. In the past two to three years, more\nthan ten protein design models based on diffusion models have emerged. Among\nthem, the representative model, RFDiffusion, has demonstrated success rates in\n25 protein design tasks that far exceed those of traditional methods, and other\nAI-based approaches like RFjoint and hallucination. This review will\nsystematically examine the application of diffusion models in generating\nprotein backbones and sequences. We will explore the strengths and limitations\nof different models, summarize successful cases of protein design using\ndiffusion models, and discuss future development directions.",

    "summary": "Prediction of ligand binding sites of proteins is a fundamental and important\ntask for understanding the function of proteins and screening potential drugs.\nMost existing methods require experimentally determined protein holo-structures\nas input. However, such structures can be unavailable on novel or less-studied\nproteins. To tackle this limitation, we propose LaMPSite, which only takes\nprotein sequences and ligand molecular graphs as input for ligand binding site\npredictions. The protein sequences are used to retrieve residue-level\nembeddings and contact maps from the pre-trained ESM-2 protein language model.\nThe ligand molecular graphs are fed into a graph neural network to compute\natom-level embeddings. Then we compute and update the protein-ligand\ninteraction embedding based on the protein residue-level embeddings and ligand\natom-level embeddings, and the geometric constraints in the inferred protein\ncontact map and ligand distance map. A final pooling on protein-ligand\ninteraction embedding would indicate which residues belong to the binding\nsites. Without any 3D coordinate information of proteins, our proposed model\nachieves competitive performance compared to baseline methods that require 3D\nprotein structures when predicting binding sites. Given that less than 50% of\nproteins have reliable structure information in the current stage, LaMPSite\nwill provide new opportunities for drug discovery.",

    "summary": "Designing de novo proteins beyond those found in nature holds significant\npromise for advancements in both scientific and engineering applications.\nCurrent methodologies for protein design often rely on AI-based models, such as\nsurrogate models that address end-to-end problems by linking protein structure\nto material properties or vice versa. However, these models frequently focus on\nspecific material objectives or structural properties, limiting their\nflexibility when incorporating out-of-domain knowledge into the design process\nor comprehensive data analysis is required. In this study, we introduce\nProtAgents, a platform for de novo protein design based on Large Language\nModels (LLMs), where multiple AI agents with distinct capabilities\ncollaboratively address complex tasks within a dynamic environment. The\nversatility in agent development allows for expertise in diverse domains,\nincluding knowledge retrieval, protein structure analysis, physics-based\nsimulations, and results analysis. The dynamic collaboration between agents,\nempowered by LLMs, provides a versatile approach to tackling protein design and\nanalysis problems, as demonstrated through diverse examples in this study. The\nproblems of interest encompass designing new proteins, analyzing protein\nstructures and obtaining new first-principles data -- natural vibrational\nfrequencies -- via physics simulations. The concerted effort of the system\nallows for powerful automated and synergistic design of de novo proteins with\ntargeted mechanical properties. The flexibility in designing the agents, on one\nhand, and their capacity in autonomous collaboration through the dynamic\nLLM-based multi-agent environment on the other hand, unleashes great potentials\nof LLMs in addressing multi-objective materials problems and opens up new\navenues for autonomous materials discovery and design.",

    "summary": "Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) promise autonomous discovery, yet\nmost systems still resurface knowledge latent in their training data. We\npresent Sparks, a multi-modal multi-agent AI model that executes the entire\ndiscovery cycle that includes hypothesis generation, experiment design and\niterative refinement to develop generalizable principles and a report without\nhuman intervention. Applied to protein science, Sparks uncovered two previously\nunknown phenomena: (i) a length-dependent mechanical crossover whereby\nbeta-sheet-biased peptides surpass alpha-helical ones in unfolding force beyond\n~80 residues, establishing a new design principle for peptide mechanics; and\n(ii) a chain-length/secondary-structure stability map revealing unexpectedly\nrobust beta-sheet-rich architectures and a \"frustration zone\" of high variance\nin mixed alpha/beta folds. These findings emerged from fully self-directed\nreasoning cycles that combined generative sequence design, high-accuracy\nstructure prediction and physics-aware property models, with paired\ngeneration-and-reflection agents enforcing self-correction and reproducibility.\nThe key result is that Sparks can independently conduct rigorous scientific\ninquiry and identify previously unknown scientific principles.",
