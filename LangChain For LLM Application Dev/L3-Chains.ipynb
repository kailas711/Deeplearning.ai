The people affected by the news are all refiners in India who are using PJSC Sovcomflot tankers to import crude oil from Russia.\\n3. The reason for the refinery's refusal is the US sanctions on Russia, which prohibit the importation of Russian crude oil.\\n4.

At higher temperatures, it emits more short-wavelength (high-frequency) radiation, such as visible light, ultraviolet, and X-rays. At lower temperatures, it emits longer-wavelength (lower-frequency) radiation, such as infrared and radio waves. The spectrum of black body radiation is described by the Planck distribution law, which relates the intensity of radiation to wavelength and temperature.<|im_end|>'"

Here it is:\\n\\nFind the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 * sin(x).\\n\\nTo find the derivative of this function, we can use the sum rule and the product rule of differentiation. The sum rule states that if we have two functions g(x) and h(x), then the derivative of their sum is the sum of their derivatives: (g(x) + h(x))'.\\n\\nThe product rule states that if we have a function p(x) = u(x) * v(x), where u(x) and v(x) are differentiable functions, then the derivative of p(x) is given by:\\n\\np'(x) = u'(x) * v(x) + u(x) * v'(x)\\n\\nNow let's apply these rules to find the derivative of f(x) = x^3 * sin(x):\\n\\nFirst, we identify the two functions in our product: u(x) = x^3 and v(x) = sin(x).\\n\\nNext, we find the derivatives of each function:\\n\\nu'(x) = 3x^2\\nv'(x) = cos(x)\\n\\nNow we can apply the product rule to find the derivative of our original function:\\n\\nf'(x) = u'(x) * v(x) + u(x) * v'(x)\\n= (3x^2) * sin(x) + x^3 * cos(x)\\n\\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = x^3 * sin(x) is:\\n\\nf'(x) = 3x^2 * sin(x) + x^3 * cos(x)\""
