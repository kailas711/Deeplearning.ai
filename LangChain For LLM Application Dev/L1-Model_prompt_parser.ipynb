When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it encounters various gases such as nitrogen and oxygen. These gases scatter (bounce) the light in all directions. The color of light that is scattered depends on its wavelength. Shorter wavelength colors like blue and violet are scattered more than longer wavelength colors like red and orange. This is why we see the sky appear blue. As the sun approaches the horizon, the amount of atmosphere between us and the sun increases, causing even more scattering and making the sky appear redder or more orange as a result.\"},\n",
