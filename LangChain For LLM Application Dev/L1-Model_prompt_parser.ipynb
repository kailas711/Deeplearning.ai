This is because sunlight contains different colors of light and our eyes are sensitive to certain wavelengths more than others.\\nWhen we look at the sky, the sunlight passing through Earth's atmosphere interacts with molecules in the air (like water droplets or dust particles) and other gases. The wavelength of light that is refracted (bent) by these particles can be scattered into different colors depending on their speed compared to the speed of sound within the air.\\nAt sea level, at about 3600 feet above ground, sunlight reaches an altitude where the blue wavelengths have been scattered more than other longer wavelength colors. This causes the sky and clouds to appear blue to us. However, as we move higher up into the atmosphere, the concentration of air molecules decreases and light is scattered in different directions, creating a rainbow effect instead of just one single color.\\n\\nSo, to summarize, why does the sky look blue? It's because sunlight scatters due to the Earth's atmosphere and blue wavelengths are more readily scattered than other colors.\"},\n",
